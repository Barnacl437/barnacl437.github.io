<h2>:about me (TL;DR) </h2>
     <p>I am a 16 year old student, pronouned he/him (but any call is accepted) who are interested in computer and technology, an amateur enthusiast at something, seems nerdy without glasses, and unindependented.<br>
     <br> I live in UTC+7 timezone (Hanoi), my 12:00 p.m. is your... uh, calc yourself.<br>
     <br> I have a certain enthusiastic in FOSS (free and open-source software), reading book (if it fits my flavour), like playing games, 
     listening to random genre of music/podcast and seldomly watching (Japanese) cartoon or normal movie. I am not a weeb tho, since I am not into Japanese culture or elses. Just enjoying media.
     I am a big fan of monologue (self-talking), this helped me a lot on practicing my language and communication skill. However, I am still shy enough to not actively reach out to some real people, unless they speak Vietnamese (lol)<br>
     <br>I also have a medium to high-level of self-awareness, and I am good at making sudden and weirdsome turns 
     to some people in my Discord friend list if they recently did something that made me feel uncomfortable, which may be in risk of ruining friendships. Not too serious, however, but if you want to be my friend just stay nice and no worries. I appreciate kindness, after all.<br>
     <br>A little thing that you may (want to) know, I have a sense of humour and I can do some sorta kid/joke everywhere. Just don't make it go worse, I am fine with it.<br>
     <br>I don't know if I am introverted or not, but I can talk with anyone who has the same topic and thought with me, otherwise I only play alone. ADHD? Asperger? No. LGBTQ+ state? Straight. Male. But I support them.<br>
    
     <br> Some language I know, including both human and programming language:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Vietnamese: My primary language and mother tongue. I am not so good at analysing literature works, but I am enough at 4 basic communication skills. Some skill at argumentation.</li>
        <li>English: My second language. Still learning everyday, and I have no much idea what level am I at. Perhaps between modest and competent. 
          Not good at listening, I usually turn on caption when playing media. I'm striving to learn and speak in proper Australian accent (aka strine or Strayan), because just for somehow I like the culture here.</li>
        <li>toki pona: <a href="https://tokipona.org">A simple human language</a> created by Sonja Lang in 2001. I've started learning it since early 2022. 
          But I still get at below than conversationable, due to various factors. Still learning though whenever I can. In fact, toki pona changed my way of thinking and keep my thought somewhat simpler and more open.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS: This came up to my mind when I "was wanting" to create a website. I have slowly learned them since 2021 and now I know a basic amount,
        enough to build a website like this. I can't make a complex website but I can manipulate some CSS tricks from the Internet to achieve a small visual improvement to it.</li>
        <li>Python: I decided to learn it because it's easy to start. C family seems too much for me. 
          I am currently still not so good at it and can only recall some basic feature like printing string, var def, function binding and that's all. Still learning.</li>
        <li>Lua: Stopped learning after a short time in 2022. I think I'd rather learn Python first.</li>
    
      </ul>
   <br> and maybe some others that I am about to learn in a future time. I have participated in no major project so far, just because I lack basic coding skill. 
    But anyways, I think I can do something to improve it eventually.<br><br>
    <br>My current favourite games (doesn't mean I always play them): Half-Life 2/Episodic, Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Apex Legends(?), Cave Story, and a lot more. Also Counter-Strike 2 for its updated Source 2 engine. <br>
     
   <br>This site is manually managed and all the 'blog articles' are written with code inside, by hand. It's not as fast and easy as a blog-dedicated web service, but it's fine for me to do anything on my own. Also 'blog posts' will have no
    comment system, and updating as well as composing time would take a while.</p>
