     <br>Greetings. This site is a something something of mine, maybe a personal blog, portfolio or a stuff-dedicated site to improve my HTML skill.<br>  
   <br>This website used to be <span style="color:lightblue">hosted on Neocities</span>. View it <a href="https://barnacl437.neocities.org">here</a> if ya want.</p>
   

   <p id="social-links">:find me on the Internet: social medias and contact<br>
   <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/Barnacl437"> Le X/Twitter profile.</a> <br>
   <br> I have a YouTube channel, but just upload something for fun. Not gonna link to it. <br>
   <br> <a href="https://github.com/Barnacl437">GitHub @barnacl437</a> <br>
   <br> I'm also on Reddit but not much. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/This-is-Barnacle"> u/This-is-Barnacle</a><br>
   <br> For a game platform, I'm mainly active on Steam. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/barnacl437">Vaporisin'.</a><br>
   <br> This link is a little long, and an Xbox profile. <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Profile?xr=Barnacl437&csrf=RTGKyxoBcKK0oT28uTLKfL5WKfOuXHLzFusNTntgvXEcp42oHQ2FkyT5j_Sb4KUgsOyhXnLoJg9o_0vdlvdkCHVpVPE1&wa=wsignin1.0">uhmm title</a><br>
   <br> Twitch but I don't stream much recently, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/barnacl437">but there it is.</a><br>
   <br> I use Discord but in light theme. Barnacl#6939 (edit: obsolete, it's barnacl437.)<br>
   <br> ...prefer an open-source platform? I have a Mastodon account too, it's <a href="https://mas.to/@barnacl437">@barnacl437</a> at mas.to. Maybe I can use other Mastodon server as well, will add l8r.<br>
   <br> I recently have a <a href="https://barnacl437.bsky.social">Bluesky account</a> too. This 
   <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/barnacl437.github.io">link</a> also work.  <br>
   <br> ...oh, and <a href="https://barnacl437.substack.com">Substack</a> too. I feel more motivated writing there. I will temporarily put my blog aside. 
   <br>...<br>
   <br>Still using a sorta SMTP and/or simply want to approach me via email? You can mail this dude at terragodof@gmail.com or barnacl437@proton.me. Well, I don't prefer a thing to another, so it's your decision to choose one. However I rarely look at Gmail inbox now since I mainly use Proton Mail, so it's recommended to send me via Proton.

       under a simple technology; just a styled content wall. It should take around 20kB of data at least on lower
