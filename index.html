     <br>G'day internet friends. It's <span style="color:aqua">barnacl437</span>. I've got a website, for years long, to learn the 101 of html and css.<br>
     <br>You are at the index page which powers navigation of probably many websites you've ever seen.<br>  
   <br>This website used to be <span style="color:lightblue">hosted on Neocities</span>. View it <a href="https://barnacl437.neocities.org">here</a> if ya want. It's really nothing and an unfancy visual.</p>
   
<div style="border-style: groove; border-color: rgb(101, 16, 180); text-align:justify;">
   
   <p id="social-links">:find me on the Internet: social medias and contact<br>
   <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/Barnacl437"> Le X/Twitter profile.</a> <br>
   <br> I have a YouTube channel, but just upload something for fun. Not gonna link to it. <br>
   <br> Yes, GitHub, well, I don't code something much, but just some of my personal projects. <a href="https://github.com/Barnacl437">@barnacl437</a> <br>
   <br> I'm also on Reddit but not much. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/This-is-Barnacle"> u/This-is-Barnacle</a><br>
   <br> For a game platform, I'm mainly active on Steam. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/barnacl437">Vaporisin'.</a><br>
   <br> This link is a little long, and an Xbox profile. <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Profile?xr=Barnacl437&csrf=RTGKyxoBcKK0oT28uTLKfL5WKfOuXHLzFusNTntgvXEcp42oHQ2FkyT5j_Sb4KUgsOyhXnLoJg9o_0vdlvdkCHVpVPE1&wa=wsignin1.0">uhmm title</a><br>
   <br> My Twitch channel, which I started boasting when I have time, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/barnacl437">and there it is</a>.<br>
   <br> I use Discord but in light theme. Barnacl#6939 (edit: obsolete, it's barnacl437.)<br>
   <br> ...prefer an open-source platform? I have a Mastodon account too, it's <a href="https://mas.to/@barnacl437">@barnacl437</a> at mas.to. Maybe I can use other Mastodon server as well, will add l8r.<br>
   <br> I recently have a <a href="https://barnacl437.bsky.social">Bluesky account</a> too. This 
   <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/barnacl437.github.io">link</a> also work.  <br>
   <br> ...oh, and <a href="https://barnacl437.substack.com">Substack</a> too. I feel more motivated writing there. I will temporarily put my blog aside. 
   <br>...<br>
   <br>Still keen on using a bit of SMTP or just wanna drop me an email? You can ping this bloke at terragodof at gmail dot com or barnacl437 at proton dot me. I’m not fussed either way, so it’s up to you. But just a heads up, I hardly check me Gmail anymore, quite freq on Proton now, so best to hit me up there. Spammers' alert: I will <span style="color:chartreuse"><em>poke fun of you</em></span> on the internet if you send me junks.

    <p>This page is designed to be lightweight and capable on anything that supports HTML and CSS 
      basic colouring (optional), so feel free to read it via Internet Explorer or newer Netscape Navigation
       versions as long as they supports https to be able to access. Either way, this website is still built 
       under a simple technology; just a styled content wall. It should take around 20kB of data at least on lower
      browsing device and up to few dozens of megs on modern browsers.</p>
