   <p id="paragraph">Greetings. This site is a something something of mine, maybe a personal blog, portfolio or a stuff-dedicated site to improve my HTML skill.<br>  
   <br>This is a clone from my Neocities website. View it <a href="https://barnacl437.neocities.org">here</a>.</p> 
   
  
   <p>:about me (TL;DR) <br>
     <br>I am a 16 year old student, pronouned he/him (but any call is accepted) who are interested in computer and technology, an amateur enthusiast at something, seems nerdy without glasses, and unindependented.<br>
     <br> I live in UTC+7 timezone (Hanoi), my 12:00 p.m. is your... uh, calc yourself.<br>
     <br> I have a certain enthusiastic in FOSS (free and open-source software), reading book (if it fits my flavour), like playing games, 
     listening to random genre of music/podcast and seldomly watching (Japanese) cartoon or normal movie. I am a big fan of monologue (self-talking), this helped me a lot on practicing my language and communication skill.<br>
     <br>I don't know if I am introverted or not, but I can talk with anyone who has the same topic and thought with me, otherwise I only play alone.<br>
     <br> Some language I know, including both human and programming language:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Vietnamese: My primary language and mother tongue. I am not so good at analysing literature works, but I am enough at 4 basic communication skills. Some skill at argumentation.</li>
        <li>English: My second language. Still learning everyday, and I have no much idea what level am I at. Perhaps between modest and competent. 
          Not good at listening, I usually turn on caption when playing media.</li>
        <li>toki pona: <a href="https://tokipona.org">A simple human language</a> created by Sonja Lang in 2001. I've started learning it since early 2022. 
          But I still get at below than conversationable, due to various factors. Still learning though whenever I can.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS: This came up to my mind when I "was wanting" to create a website. I have slowly learned them since 2021 and now I know a basic amount,
        enough to build a website like this. I can't make a complex website but I can manipulate some CSS tricks from the Internet to achieve a small visual improvement to it.</li>
        <li>Python: I decided to learn it because it's easy to start. C family seems too much for me. 
          I am currently still not so good at it and can only recall some basic feature like printing string, var def, function binding and that's all. Still learning.</li>
        <li>Lua: Stopped learning after a short time in 2022. I think I'd rather learn Python first.</li>
    
      </ul>
   <br> and that's all. I have participated in no major project so far, just because I lack basic coding skill. But anyways, I think I can do something to improve it eventually.<br>
     
   <br>This site is manually managed and all the 'blog articles' are written with code inside, by hand. It's not as fast and easy as a blog-dedicated web service, but it's fine for me to do anything on my own.<br>

   <br>:me on the Internet<br>

   <br> I have a YouTube channel, but just upload something for fun. Not gonna link to it. <br>
   <br> I do some commissions and issuings. <a href="https://github.com/Barnacl437">GitHub profile</a> <br>
   <br> I'm also on Reddit and once witnessing r/Place '22 happens. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/This-is-Barnacle"> u/This-is-Barnacle</a><br>
   <br> There's a Steam account. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/barnacl437">Vaporisin'.</a><br>
   <br> This link is a little long, and an Xbox profile. <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Profile?xr=Barnacl437&csrf=RTGKyxoBcKK0oT28uTLKfL5WKfOuXHLzFusNTntgvXEcp42oHQ2FkyT5j_Sb4KUgsOyhXnLoJg9o_0vdlvdkCHVpVPE1&wa=wsignin1.0">uhmm title</a><br>
   <br> Twitch but I don't stream much recently, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/barnacl437">but there it is.</a><br>
   <br> I use Discord but in light theme. Barnacl#6939<br>
   <br> ...prefer an open-source platform? I have a Mastodon account too, it's @barnacl437 at mas.to. Maybe I can use other Mastodon server as well, will add l8r.<br>
   <br>...<br>
   <br>Still using a sorta SMTP and/or simply want to approach me via email? You can mail this dude at terragodof@gmail.com or barnacl437@proton.me. Well, I don't prefer a thing to another, so it's your decision to choose one. BTW my Gmail is full of trash tho, so... but nvm you can choose either what you want.

For Linux/mobile/other platform users, they use a different font system or this font is simply not included or not supported, and will use default/customised font settings of the system.</p>
