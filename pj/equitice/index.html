        <p style="font-size:2em;">project equitice</p>
        <p>My early attempt to record temperature changes annually through four key solar terms in a year (winter/summer solstice and march/september equinox).</p>
        <h4>more info...</h4>
        <p>
            At first it seems to be just a hobby work, and yes it is certainly a hobby project. But I also want something to do 
            in my free time, and to learn something about long-term weather cycles, as well as monitoring current progress of climate change.<br>
            My plan right now is to make table-form records, and will release a csv file that'll be updated after the winter solstice.<br></p>
        <h4>how i will work on this</h4>
            <p>
            I will try to maintain this peoject as long as possible and whenever I'm free, but sometimes my records may not be dated the exact day of solstice/equinox. For the case, I will give an offset limit of (+/-)7 days. If I can't make it on time, the record will be left blank (or a special indication meaning it was skipped).<br>
            Weather data used will can be gathered from various sources (preferrably from libre/open-source projects). Weather data can be location-dependant, so I will create separated pages for each location, which may be listed below.
