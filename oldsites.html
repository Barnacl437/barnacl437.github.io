  <h2> ...old sites?</h2>
  <p>:um, I mean some communities and/or places that are retro styled and talk about retro stuff. Well, I'm a sorta into retro things, but I don't have too much knowledge about old computers. But I still chose taking a way in and seeing people discussing about their interests. (old but they are kinda new lmao, they're just old looking.)<br>
  <br>Gotta list some below maybe:<br>
  <br>-<a href="https://bbs.fozztexx.com">Level 29 BBS</a> --this one was my first BBS I've ever visited (ofc, from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnvBQB9BLEo">video</a>.) You can access it via a telnet client to bbs.fozztexx.com, or go directly to the site and use the shellinabox embedded frame, or dialup to the number shown in the webpage. Additionally, you can visit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations">r/retrobattlestations</a> as well. (Never been there before, but I think I should take a look.)<br>
  <br>-<a href="http://oldnet.co.za">oldnet.co.za</a> --someone in Level 29 (pyrodrake) just opened this site with HTTP protocol. You can find something fun to play around here, in those PHP-written pages. Since it is launched in HTTP, you can better access it on old computers with limited network conditions. (update: this is currently down and I can't contact the operator. Index failed.<br>
  <br>-<a href="http://telehack.com">Telehack</a> --I was once being here in the past, under the name barn2. You can access this via either a Telnet or SSH client.</p>
  <p> Well, that's all up to now. I may update this later if possible.</p>
