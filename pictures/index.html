    <h1> Pikture </h1>
    <p> A place for pictures storing here. This includes images in JPG, PNG, WEBP or more, even SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, an XML-based image format that uses vector graphics to draw images. Moreover, SVG is open-source either!)<br>
    <br>Usually, access to images is open, but not the directory (If a directory has no index.html file, when you try to access it, then you will be given back a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403">403 forbidden error</a>; the access to directories has been disabled on most of web servers you see on the interwebz, yet there's a way to enable the thing if you are on your own ones). So, you can only see the image if you know its existence; but you can't see the directory, so there's no easier way for you to find out.</p>
    <p>Lil' reminding: This index page is created only for fun and appearance purpose only; no actual picture will be shown hereby. <br>
      <br>OBTW, this isn't Neocities. You can browse the images via this page's repo.</p>
    <p color= black;> Fun fact: on the URL bar, replace the index.html which is behind the /pictures/ with index.<i>svg</i> (or add that if there's no index.html residents) and see what happens.</p>
