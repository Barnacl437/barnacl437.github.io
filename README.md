# [barnacl437.github.io](https://barnacl437.github.io)
Repo for hosting my sites. I've been using [Neocities](neocities.org) currently but I decided to make a brief fork from it. ~~I can maintain both working.
Edit: I may sometimes only focus on maintaining the GitHub site. At least so.~~ No. I stopped looking at Neocities thing rn.

## About stuff 
These webpages are made lightweight despite having many texts inside and (somewhat) fancy CSS looking. It can be healthy for weak connection, old browsers or crap memory amount, as long as it's hosted on concurrent accessible servers, such as no-SSL/HTTPS or HTTP-only connection.
I created this just to cure/satisfy my willing to create a new own webpage on my hand, using my skill to improve it overtime. I decided to keep everything simple for now.

## Usage
If you are not literated in basic HTML coding, you can, yes, copy the code then do anything you want. Find some weird things in there? Nevermind. Otherwise just reading. This is my personal webpage. Or use it as reading a personal blog. idk do wtf u want.

## License
released under [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). Yes, you may not bother wanting to read all of that long in GNU GPL. I don't criticise GNU, but with my stuff that is/are not going to be serious, I choose WTFPL for minimal further trouble.

## Other trivias and information
This website uses [Intel One Mono](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono), an open-source font by Intel intended for developers to use on their IDE editor with ease to read and convenient. Thus I've chosen it to display on my site. However, I can't make this font readable on any devices beyond my personal computer. Gotta work on this later.

kay thatz all have fun.
