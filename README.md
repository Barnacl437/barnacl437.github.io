# [barnacl437.github.io](https://barnacl437.github.io)
Repo for hosting my sites. I've been using [Neocities](neocities.org) currently but I decided to make a brief fork from it. I can maintain both working.
(This is a clean clone from Neocities host and contain original contents which may say something Neocities-related such as "hosted by [Neocities logo"], will fix it soon.)

## About stuff 
These webpage are made lightweight despite having many texts inside and (somewhat) fancy CSS looking. It can be healthy for weak connection, old browsers or crap memory amount, as long as it's hosted on concurrent accessible servers, such as no-SSL/HTTPS or HTTP-only connection.

## Usage
If you are not literated in basic HTML coding, you can, yes, copy the code then do anything you want. Find some weird things in there? Nevermind. Otherwise just reading. This is my personal webpage. Or use it as reading a personal blog. idk do wtf u want.

## License
released under [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org). Yes, you may not bother wanting to read all of that long in GNU GPL. I don't criticise GNU, but with my stuff that is/are not going to be serious, I choose WTFPL for minimal further trouble.

kay thatz all have fun.
