# barnacl437.github.io
Repo for hosting my sites. I've been using Neocities currently but I decided to make a brief fork from it. I can maintain both working.
## Usage
If you are not literated in basic HTML coding, you can, yes, copy the code then do anything you want. Find some weird things in there? Nevermind. Otherwise just reading. This is my personal webpage.

## License
released under [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org). Yes, you may not bother wanting to read all of that long in GNU GPL. I don't criticise GNU, but with my stuff that is/are not going to be serious, I choose WTFPL for minimal further trouble.
