===My blacklist for potentially unwanted sites, compiled under .txt form===
barnacl437, 2024

This is another attempt of mine trying to address every scamming, unwanted or other kind of websites
that I recommend for some playful and (hopefully) ethical DDoS attacks on them. May include betting 
or (possibly) lotto, gambling sites which is illegal in some nations, and may cause huge loss to the
player's side. This is logged in a txt file for simpler reading and data exporting for analysis.

I started logging since 2024/3/9 @ 12:50am UTC. Will be updated frequently. May not be chronically
ordered.


Recorded data form convention:
[siteName] [protocol:isSecure] [dateTime:YYYY/MM/DD] [isUpInLastUpdatedTime (up/down)] [misc_optional]
(space is natural separation, colon is cluster separation, slash/dash is partial separation, datas must be space-less)
