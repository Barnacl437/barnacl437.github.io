<h3 class="sheading" id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>    The <span style="color:coral">archive</span> section is a place where things are stored like a storage, 
    making use of any host's disc space, and use html as a clientside read-only fileviewer. In an unpredicted 
    future, however, this section could expand its purpose to not just function as a storage hub.<br>
    
<br>This section (folder of webpages), as well as the rest of this website (except where otherwise noted), is released under <a href="http://wtfpl.net">WTFPL</a> (Do what the F*** you want to do) licence. You are free to copy, even a portion of this page, modify it entirely, sell or distribute it, for your own purposes, or use as a template for 
your own simple projects.<br>

<br>There are better ways to make a file viewer on the web, but with this project, the author who made it ("the author")
wants to try and demonstrate how good can a file viewer be made, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> (keep it simple stupid) principle. Only a minimal amount of JS used, but not for any crucial function.<br>
<br>This document is in progress and is subject to amend without prior notices. (cuz why lmao, i dont want to make a mailing list that would be sent to every 8 billion of the world population xdd)</p>

<h2 class="sheading" id="file-system">File system</h2>
    The "file system" is, de facto, a folder which contains files, for storage purpose. <br>
<br>Currently, there is one such file system on this archive, <a href="/archive/fs1/index.bfsv0.htm">fs1</a>.
