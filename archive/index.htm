<h2>lil' corner of archival</h2>
<p>
    This is a space functioning as a simple virtual file system which, I can put some small stuff in there to use something on my repository's storage (for large files I will attach an external site notify). Currently underway. This will eventuallly replace the older <a href="/snippets/">snippets</a> which is not utilised for a long time and still staying around just inside my concept.<br>
    <br>
    By pulling stuff outta here, I reckon I wanna share somethin with ya all, but the big goal is to have a personal file vault (you know the drill), but a safe one to boast about online. It's also my chance to show off a simple directory viewer, which is, to be fair dinkum, built with a bit of rice, meat, and effort – just a basic start. It’ll take a fair whack of time, but I'm keen to give it a go anyway.<br>
