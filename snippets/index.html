    <h1>snippets</h1>
  </p> This is a place to store code snippets, notes, text, or something you would like to save, like a pastebin. <br>
    <br>Want to save here? Just fork the repo to your own, then add something here, make a pull req. and wait. I will approve changes/req. mostly for this case.</p>
    <p>----------</p>
  <p>:what?
  <br>Previously this folder was named 'repo' (but it doesn't work with Git), then I turned it into a text storage.</p>
    <p>Note: no item would be shown here. View <a href="https://github.com/Barnacl437/barnacl437.github.io">source code on GitHub</a> to find something. </p>
