  <h1> about the site color </h1>
  <p> Um so, I was about to create a .css file called xmas.css outta there to change the page theme to a bit red, green, white and stuff for the festive atmosphere.<br>
  <br> FYI, it is <i>heavily in progress</i> so something may looks or reminds you of... whatever (LUL).<br>
  <br> Also something else on my site that I would need to fix.<br>
  <br> (OBTW, I think I'd like to try hosting my website on a real computer too later.)<br>
  <br> That's all. Merry Christmas!</p>
  <p> [ended BTW]<br>
