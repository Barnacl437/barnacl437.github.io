  <h2>RSSus experiment?</h2>
    <p>uh yeh, been so long I haven't add new thing to my site. Just came across someone's website and they have RSS subscription, why don't I try it?<br>
    <br>Seems nice. Also the basic thing under an RSS feed is an XML file containing items and links to your blog article instituted in the homepage.
      Even the most basic shit like this page can make an RSS feed to be connected using apps or clients.<br>
    <br>Yes. Time to experiment. Expect the result in a later post... <br>
    <br>kthxbye.</p>
