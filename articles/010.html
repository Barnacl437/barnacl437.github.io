  <p>okay. it's been a while again. Summer.<br>
 <br>after a whole time struggling in exams and studying, eventually i have reached what is called "my last peaceful
    summer holiday" (i will be a grade 12-er next year and to fight with an even more extensive thing). <br>
<br>So I think before the time goes on and things become more extensive over time, I will do something for this summer 
    holiday. <br>
<br>my break have started since around 25/May and the first ten-day seems to have passed. But no worries mate, I already
    sorted out for some plans. Including learning Python too. More thing in the next post. Stay tuned.<br>
<br>...and that's all. See ya at the next (there might be some more interesting things to write out here). </p>
