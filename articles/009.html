  <h2>the way of mine, seeking idea and feeling leisure</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    Recently I have nothing much to write. Just telling random shits lol. Maybe about how I find my idea in life.<br>
<br>I usually go out. Yes, but most of time during school and dorm I quite stay indoor. But let's tell about going outside.
    I can go outside when there's really nothing to do. Yes, otherwise I would stay at home with my electronic device like
    phone or laptop. I feel quite better when I can eventually disconnect from a Discord chat and can fully feel the true
    ambient around me for a long time. At least, the feeling of freedom. When you chat, especially when word battling with
    someone you see on the chat, it may find competing and somewhat feel frustrating when you can't get over someone. I 
    know that which has been part of my mind for a long time since, but due to my excess social media usage, I also 
    realised but couldn't find a good remedy to fully solve my case. So I would recommend going out for releasing your tense
    and also to seek new ideas better, since you would have more chance to think about everything.<br>
<br>What do I do when I go out? Well just going around and sometimes grabbing some snacks. I eat fast food quite much and also 
    a big fan of it. Well fortunately I didn't meet a symptom of eating them too much. At some extent, I am fine.<br>
<br>Well, I am (sorta) into photograph too. Even when my phone camera has only a front one working (yes, it was water damaged)
    but it was shooting fine, at least when the camera is only 8MP (3264x2448). I shoot everything, but the image quality 
    sounds not okay in low light condition. Probably due to it being a front cam lmao. Exposure is sometimes wacky, but 
    looks best when shooting sun and sky scenes in a good weather. Photographing is not my career, but rather than that, it's 
    better considered as a lil' hobby.<br>
<br>So after all of these, what (kind of) idea can you get from them? Well, it does not have to be certain. My mind is full of
    random idea ngl, so I can come out with literally anything inside my knowledge, like making a melody or thinking about a
    concept of an electronic thingy. So it's up to you, but I feel like that, I am quite rich in idea but my ideas are usually
    out of reach. I think I need to achieve an actual skill to fulfill what I always have wanted. But after all, I still have 
    a rich imagination right...<br>
    <br>a bit more for today. See ya, the internet.</p>
