  <h2>Embed PC emulator based on JavaScript! (with <a href="https://www.pcjs.org">PCjs</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jeffpar">Jeff Parsons</a>)</h2>
  
  <p> Yeah, you know. It always seems that I usually try very much things up. Today I just stumbled on PCjs, a web-based oldskool x86 PC emulator by Jeff Parsons.
  I remember once using it like years ago, but recently a sudden recall took it back into my mind. So I think I'd try it again. This time I've known a lot of things more than me before, so I should understand well what's it doing. 
  <br><br> OBTW, it allows me to embed the emulator here, so I guess you can try it right here. Otherwise you can go to their website. The machine emulated here is a Compaq Deskpro 386.</p>
