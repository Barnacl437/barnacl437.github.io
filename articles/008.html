    <p>Well, just a while I didn't write something here. <br>
      <br> I kinda found out a way to link a GitHub Pages domain to Discord connections (aka linking on your Discord bio) section as well as Bluesky custom handle too. You can read more <a href="https://github.com/barnacl437/.well-known">here</a>.
  <br>tldr: there are some tricks to help you verify your domain via DNS method using text file containing your specific kind of ID which Discord/Bluesky give it to you to be put on your domains. If they could find it, they would officially recognise your legal ownership to your domains, thus making it possible to custom or add your handy domains to show out with people.
<br> On the other side, I just also tried out adding a custom domain from <a href="https://noip.com">NoIP</a>. It quite worked except it always connects you thru ol' days HTTP protocols. Don't worry, if it says something like "insecure connection" keep in mind that this is a GitHub Pages site and <i>even if</i> I try to do something malicious to y'all readers there, my repo could always be reported and bammed by Mr. GitHub. Yes, trust me I would never do that lol (update: it now uses HTTPS. Whoopsie oopsie). Just look how nice a domain could be, below.</p>

<p>Also if you can notice a CNAME file in my repo directory tree, well, it contains a URL I registered on NoIP which points the DNS resolution to this GitHub Pages. It probably is showing on your URL bar right now. Sometimes when I mess up the DNS configuration this site can appear a 404 error. If you visited the page during those times, I'm a bit sorry. I might have been experimenting stuff. Or even vandalising like a wild and naive child. <br> P/S: after a month NoIP will try to purge your URL if you do not confirm your URL is active. So yes, this site will be down if I forget things are up. Considering not using custom URL or switching domain rn.<br>
  <br>Well, that's probably everything for this. Now, by the way, I'd like to update my current status a lil' bit. <i>If you don't care then you can safely skip it, since I write it very long and may distract your current attention about writing a tech-related topic.</i> <br>
 <br>I am still learning code beside studying a highschool curriculum (I'm at grade 11). It's really a pressure to me that I still couldn't code a good program in any major programming language, but at least I could justify myself for having not enough free time or being lazy ass, a casual procrastinator lord, being shy to ask in forums, refuse to get new knowledges, using outdated brain firmware, stucking in the 2000s, my GTX 1050 laptop can't run <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-pc-specs-stun-fans-with-its-hefty-recommended-requirements">Alan Wake 2</a> or a vast fucking of either unreliable or unbelievable reason. Yes. But I still hope, somehow, to be able to code a program and commit it to the open-source community. <br>
 <br> The thing is that I won't choose to attend in an IT university, but probably I will still go to university (ofc what else do you want xd) and learn bachelor to be an English teacher. Well, that's my dad's navigation. I don't even know what field would I attend. Cuz I don't believe in myself for being a decent English speaker. I delayed an IELTS training progress and currently everything I learn about English is from the Internet's rich source. Quite effective but that's not everything to be outcome. So well, I'm still considering much about my future career path.<br>
 <br> Well, that's all. If you still care about the tldr thing I wrote then, nice done lmfao. At least for now. See ya at a later post.
