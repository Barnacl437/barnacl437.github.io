  <h1>page looking on Lynx browser</h1> <p>(also a picture attachment testing) </p>
  <p>So I was running Windows Subsystem for Debian Linux and installing Lynx, a text-based browser. <br>
  <br>The first thing to do after installing might be accessing Google, and also this page.<br>
  <br>It looked like below, and seems a bit programming-ish and enthusiasm, probably.</P>
  <img src="https://barnacl437.neocities.org/pictures/mypageonlynx.png">
  <p> Looks cool, just a thing that it can't display images (even in ASCII mode!). I think in this case, Neofetch seems doing good (LOL).</p>
  <p> Therefore, if you are accessing this page in Lynx, you *can't* see the image but the image name or the image link, depend on your setting in<br>
  <br> Lynx option.</p>
  <p> So, just that.</p>
