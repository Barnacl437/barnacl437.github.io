  <h2>some thought about using Linux as "daily driver" and reinstalling another distro</h2>
    <p>I have been using Linux on my main machine for a while now though. It has been good as I formerly used Windows
      daily and see that everything I did
    made it bloater over time.<br>
    
      <br>Currently at the time of writing I am using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a>. I grabbed the NVIDIA ISO as
      my laptop has a GTX 1050 card. It may sound not so ideal since it's a gaming laptop, it has Novideo card, and Windows is
      priortised to be running on such systems. But no, I don't
      suppose that. The fact that I'm still using it day-by-day and it's quite okay for me. Just the
    thing that many games fail to run on there, using Proton, a Wine version of Steam Play feature. Maybe some skill issues (lol jk).<br>

      <br>But the more I use, the more it goes the same thing like on Windows I did, but the errors are wilder. Sometimes it suddenly
    hangs during kinda high task, I don't know but it never happens on Windows before. Probably swap full? But swap full would crash the 
    whole system meanwhile the cursor still worked. Nothing won't help except a mandatory reboot.<br>
    
      <br> I am thinking of reinstalling another distro to continue my daily usage with care for stability. And I stumbled across
    <a href="https://endeavouros.com">EndeavourOS</a>. Actually I've been using this for several times since I used Windows; 
      I installed it on my second disc drive as a sub-OS for my Linux tinkering. It's fairly worth to try again though.  <br>
    <br>Well, it's time to put it on first. That "i use Arch btw" moment.<br>
    <br>That's all for now. I will write a review for it for a later time. Pop!_OS is actually excellent but some weird thing 
      happened made me decide to reinstall another OS to check for issues.<br>
    <br> kthxbye.</p>
