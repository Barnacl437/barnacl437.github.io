  <h2>what i am now</h2>
  <p>
     G'day internet friend.<br>
<<br>it's been a long time since I write my last article, and now it's also over my summer peak. 
Well I guess something would happen since August and I will have less free time due to that I will 
have to attend some summer pre-studying classes before the new school year starts in early September.
Of course there should be some short unstable breaks but that would soon end with another repeated
in-duty times. At least until Sept ditto when I will enter my <i>last grade</i> and go to the regularity.
Yep, the <i>last grade</i> I told. I have no other choice rather than to graduate senior high school
and to get a good uni, then a good scholarship/abroad studying, then a good work, that is, for my life.
You can do it, right? barnacl437?<br>

<br> That's all about my current phase now. There's another half-of-month til Aug, so I will still have
 times. But I think I still have no idea what to do tho. I will try to do some more stuff inside my 
 hobby zone until I can no longer do that freely. My dad is quite strict at that and, whispering ya this:
 He is actually putting an embargo on me for using my laptop to get me reach my target weight (sounds 
 weird, isn't it?), but fortunately he is now away for work and I think I can craft some of my own reasons
 to convince him to allow me to continue using, and phew, hope he wouldn't come back verysoon(tm).<br>

 <br> also about game a lil' bit. I bought several games during sales too. I bought GMod, 
 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/977880">Eastward</a>, and
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017180">The Long Drive</a>. Just to cure my sale hunting
desire. And I have played all of them at least one hour. Or two hours? Yep that is. Probably would like
to tell about my gaming experience a bit later. But now that's all.<br>
<br> okay, that's for today. I will try to write more if I can, even right now or tomorrow. Just as what I would
desire at a certain time. Thanks for reading.<br>
