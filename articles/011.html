  <h2>a coastal vacation: city of Nha Trang</h2>
  <p>
    G'day internet friend.<br>
<br>Honestly since the last post I didn't really do anything much beyond gaming and stuff, so well, probably I will put
    my plans aside.<br>
<br>And now I'm during a vacation in Nha Trang. If I count the time we spent on a coach which is 20 hours from Hanoi to Khanh Hoa,
    this is probably the third day. It was <i>that</i> long but at least it was a decent feel that I took shot of multiple thing on
    the road.<br>
<br>For now I've been living in an apartment room in floor of 15. It had a view that spanned from the beach to inner streets, which
    one of my friend said it had a vague reminiscent of Japan (yep i feel that too but in other ways it looks more of a Philippines
    metro, or Hong Kong, or anything else I can think of).<br>
